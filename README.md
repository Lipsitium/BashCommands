# BashCommands
Note that, I personally use them in the ".bashrc", but I'll save the commands as individual files.


### Compile and Execute Assembly
Self-explanatory, it also compiles to name "exe" by default.

ce [file].s -> compiles and executes in current directory.</br>
ce -d [directory] [file].s ->  compiles and executes in the specified directory.</br>
ce -m [file].s -> compiles and executes in current directory and mantains the name of the assembly file.</br>
