# BashCommands
Compile and Execute Assembly
Self-explanatory, it also compiles to name "exe" by default.
ce [file].s -> compiles and executes in current directory.
ce -d [directory] [file].s ->  compiles and executes in the specified directory.
ce -m [file].s -> compiles and executes in current directory and mantains the name of the assembly file.
