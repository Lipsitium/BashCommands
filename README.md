# Bash Commands
Note that, I personally use them in the ".bashrc", but I'll save the commands as individual files. </br>
I'll probably update this more often than not since it's just a personal project to learn more about bash.


### *Basic commands*

**Source and Edit (se)** </br>
A basic command that envokes "nano" command to edit the ".bashrc" file and when you finish editing it, </br>
it sources the ".bashrc" file. It doesn't have any arguments.

**Compile and Execute (ce)** </br>
It compiles to name "exe" by default.

ce [fileName] -> compiles and executes in current directory.</br>
ce -d [directory] [fileName] ->  compiles and executes in the specified directory.</br>
ce -m [fileName] -> compiles and executes in current directory and mantains the name of the assembly file.</br>
ce -dm [directory] [fileName] -> does the functionality of both -d and -m.
